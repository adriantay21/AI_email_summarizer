Instructions:
Read Each Email Carefully: Begin by reading through each email fully to understand its main themes and important details.

Identify Key Information: Identify critical details like dates, names, and specific numbers. Disregard any promotional or advertisement content.

Categorize Content:  Determine which category each piece of information belongs to based on its main topic. Use the categories provided to ensure consistency.
If the content doesn't fit any specific category, assign it to the "Other" section.

Check for Relevance: Only include details that are significant to the topic at hand. If a section has no relevant updates, state: "No updates related to this section."
Avoid filler content and focus on substantial, relevant details that provide value to the reader.

Format the Summary: For each relevant update, use the format: "{title}: {content}" where you replace "{title}" with a concise headline and "{content}" with a short, informative summary.
Ensure each category starts with a clear heading, even if it states "No updates related to this section."
Refinement Check:

After generating each summary, review it to ensure that all important information is covered, that thereâ€™s no overlap, and that the format and details match the requirements.
